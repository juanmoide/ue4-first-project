## Unreal Engine 4
This is the first project that I have developed under **Unreal Engine 4** in which I have put into practice the skills that I have acquired during December 2020 through a certified course. I have called this little videogame Extracci√≥n (Extraction in english).

### Open source / free for all
This project is used for a final project of a certified course. You can get it free and modify it by yourself. If you want to use it as a copy, at least give me a star in this repository.

For this game, I am using this version of Unreal Engine: **4.19.2**.

### Prerequisites + Download
You need to have previously downloaded **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Windows**.

You can download the compiled project clicking [here](https://github.com/juanmoide/ue4-first-project/releases/download/1.0.0.0/Extraccion.zip) or checking the [release](https://github.com/juanmoide/ue4-first-project/releases/tag/1.0.0.0) version.

Unzip the content.

Open the .exe file.

### Issues
There are some issues related to Windows such as it's not recognized as a reliable program for the system.

### How to play
This game is localized in spanish only, so, if you don't control that language you must push *jugar* button (that means to play). The main objective is to reach the house as soon as possible.

Left Mouse button for shooting
Space bar for jump

*I hope you enjoy my game such as I have enjoyed developing it*
